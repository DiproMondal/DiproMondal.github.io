        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          I am an avid PC gamer and enjoy exploring different genres, mainly story-driven RPGs and FPS games. 
          Gaming is not only entertainment for me, but also a way to challenge myself, connect with others, and experience immersive narratives.

        <h3>Anime</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy watching anime, especially series with strong storytelling, bountiful action, and creative world-building. 
          Anime has been both a source of relaxation and inspiration, often offering unique perspectives and ideas that influence my creative thinking.

        <h3>Painting & 3D Modelling</h3>
        <p>
          I used to paint extensively, which later grew into an interest in 3D modelling. 
          While I no longer have the time to explore these activities as much, they nurtured my creativity and continue to influence the way I approach both work and hobbies.
